# Welcome to ABLE
ABLE, Android Bluetooth-Low-Energy, is a framework for prototyping applications consisting of Android devices, Bluetooth LE communication, and embedded hardware. The framework takes care of the scanning and pairing process for you. It shows you a list of available Bluetooth LE devices and provides an interface to connect, display data and display GATT services and characteristics supported by the devices. So you can focus on the main issues you want to evaluate with your device.

# Tutorial
You find a detailed installation tutorial [here](https://github.com/Echtzeitsysteme/able/wiki).
